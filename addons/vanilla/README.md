Should you need to dispatch an action from simple iframe you may not want to load PostQuecast library to perform this simple action.
Or you may not be able to install the package. In such a case you can use simple `dispatchAction` function defined in here.
Just copy it to you iframe, and you can dispatch without installing anything.

> Note: It is still better to use installed version of PostQuecast. Code within addons directory can change without warning.
